## posting system

- should users have profile pictures?
- allow images in the actual blog posts?
    - if yes
        - how large should the cap be? will that be annoying for users to work around? how many images per blog post/per account? how do you notify them if they've hit the limit? should their account page have a progress bar for storage?
        - text is essentially negligible for storage space
        - tos should say please don't upload any copyrighted works
    - if no (because of file hosting logistics)
        - how to communicate that to the user
        - allow external images ... ? any xss or other weird safety issues to be aware of with that?

# aesthetics
